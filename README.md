# ü©∫ Asclepius: Cancer Detection App  
A powerful, user-friendly Android application that utilizes machine learning to detect cancer from images. This project is designed to aid early detection efforts by leveraging TensorFlow Lite and a custom-trained model for accurate predictions.  

---

## üåü Features  
Asclepius offers the following features:  
1. **Image Selection and Preview**  
   - Select images directly from your device's gallery.  
   - View a preview of the selected image within the app.  

2. **Machine Learning Integration**  
   - Utilize a custom **Cancer Classification Model** provided by Dicoding.  
   - Process images through the model using **TensorFlow Lite** for on-device predictions.  

3. **Accurate Predictions with Confidence Score**  
   - Determine if the image indicates signs of cancer.  
   - Display a confidence score for the prediction.  
   - Provide clear information about prediction results.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   - Display relevant error messages in case of processing failures.  

5. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - Clean and intuitive design for seamless user experience.  
   - Dedicated result screen (**ResultActivity**) to present predictions.

## üõ§Ô∏è My Learning Journey
Building Asclepius was a transformative experience. Starting with the Starter Project, I gained an understanding of structuring a machine learning-enabled Android application. Each milestone offered unique challenges and learning opportunities:

Image Selection and Preview: Learning to integrate the gallery with intents and display previews taught me the value of a strong foundation in Android development.
TensorFlow Lite Integration: Delving into TensorFlow Lite was both exciting and daunting. By understanding how to load models and process inputs, I realized the potential of on-device machine learning.
Result Display: Crafting the result screen to display predictions and confidence scores helped refine my UI/UX design skills.
Through this journey, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also gained a deep appreciation for how technology can make a positive impact in critical areas like healthcare.
